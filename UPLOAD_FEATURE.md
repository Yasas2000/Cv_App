# 📤 Resume Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✨ New Feature Added!

The Resume Search Application now supports **two resume sources**:
1. **Local Folder** - Use the 27 resumes from `/resumes` folder
2. **Upload Temporary** - Upload your own PDF resumes temporarily

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes (Python FastAPI)

#### 1. New API Endpoints

**POST /upload-resumes**
- Upload multiple PDF files simultaneously
- Files are stored in `/backend/temp_uploads/`
- Automatically indexes uploaded resumes
- Switches to "uploaded" mode

**POST /set-resume-source**
- Switch between "local" and "uploaded" sources
- Re-indexes resumes from selected source
- Body: `{"source": "local" | "uploaded"}`

**GET /uploaded-resumes**
- Returns list of currently uploaded resume files
- Shows count of uploaded files

**DELETE /clear-uploads**
- Removes all uploaded resumes
- Switches back to local mode
- Clears `/backend/temp_uploads/` folder

**GET /resume/{filename}** (Updated)
- Now serves PDFs from current active source
- Supports both local and uploaded resumes

#### 2. File Structure
```
backend/
├── main.py                  # Updated with new endpoints
├── resume_processor.py      # No changes needed
└── temp_uploads/            # New folder for uploaded files
```

#### 3. State Management
- Global `current_source` variable tracks active source ("local" or "uploaded")
- Status endpoint now returns current source information
- Automatic source switching on upload

---

### Frontend Changes (React + Vite)

#### 1. New UI Components

**Source Selector**
- Two radio buttons: "Local Folder" and "Uploaded"
- Shows indexed count for each source
- Real-time source switching

**Upload Section**
- "📤 Upload Resumes" button with file picker
- Supports multiple PDF file selection
- "🗑️ Clear Uploads" button to remove uploaded files

**Status Bar**
- Shows total indexed resumes
- Displays current active source

**Uploaded Files List**
- Shows all uploaded file names
- Appears when files are uploaded
- File tags with names

#### 2. New State Variables
```javascript
const [resumeSource, setResumeSource] = useState('local')
const [uploadedFiles, setUploadedFiles] = useState([])
const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false)
const [indexedCount, setIndexedCount] = useState(0)
```

#### 3. New Functions
- `handleFileUpload()` - Upload PDFs to backend
- `handleSourceChange()` - Switch between sources
- `handleClearUploads()` - Remove uploaded files
- `fetchStatus()` - Get current system status

---

### CSS Styling

**New Styles Added:**
- `.source-selector` - Container for source options
- `.source-options` - Grid layout for radio buttons
- `.source-option` - Individual source radio button card
- `.upload-section` - Upload and clear buttons
- `.upload-btn` - Styled upload button
- `.clear-btn` - Styled clear button
- `.uploaded-files` - Uploaded files list container
- `.files-list` - Flex container for file tags
- `.file-tag` - Individual file name tag
- `.status-bar` - Header status information

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Use Local Resumes (Default)
1. Start the application normally
2. The system automatically uses the 27 resumes from `/resumes` folder
3. Search and find candidates

### Option 2: Upload Your Own Resumes
1. Click **"📤 Upload Resumes"** button
2. Select one or multiple PDF resume files
3. System automatically:
   - Uploads files to `/backend/temp_uploads/`
   - Indexes them using FAISS
   - Switches to "Uploaded" mode
4. Search through your uploaded resumes
5. Click **"🗑️ Clear Uploads"** when done to return to local mode

### Switching Between Sources
- Click the radio buttons to switch:
  - **📁 Use Local Resumes Folder** - 27 local resumes
  - **☁️ Use Uploaded Resumes** - Your uploaded files
- System re-indexes immediately
- Search results update based on active source

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Notes

### Temporary Storage
- Uploaded files are stored in `/backend/temp_uploads/`
- Files are **NOT persistent** - cleared when server restarts or manually
- Each upload clears previous uploads (prevents accumulation)

### File Validation
- Backend only accepts `.pdf` files
- Non-PDF files are silently skipped
- No file size limit currently (add in production)

### Best Practices for Production
- [ ] Add file size limits (e.g., 5MB per file)
- [ ] Implement virus scanning
- [ ] Add rate limiting on upload endpoint
- [ ] Store uploads in cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Encrypt uploaded files
- [ ] Add retention policy (auto-delete after X days)
- [ ] Implement upload quotas per user

3. POST request to /upload-resumes
   ↓
4. Backend clears /temp_uploads/ folder
   ↓
5. Backend saves files to /temp_uploads/
   ↓
6. Backend calls resume_processor.index_resumes()

```

### Source Switching Flow
```
1. User clicks radio button (local/uploaded)
   ↓
2. Frontend calls handleSourceChange()
   ↓
3. POST request to /set-resume-source
   ↓
4. Backend determines resume directory path
   ↓
5. Backend calls resume_processor.index_resumes(path)
   ↓
